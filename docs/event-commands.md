# Event Commands

Run a custom shell command when a quota resets, a usage threshold is crossed, the app starts, or you trigger the double-click command from the tray menu. Commands run asynchronously and do not block the app. Event details are passed as environment variables so your command or script can use them directly.

## Settings

Add these keys to your [`usage-monitor-settings.json`](configuration.md). After saving, use the **Restart** option in the tray context menu to apply the changes.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `on_reset_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run when a quota resets (usage drops) |
| `on_startup_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run once after the first successful API update following app start |
| `on_threshold_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run when usage crosses a configured alert threshold |
| `on_double_click_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) run on demand from a dedicated tray menu entry |

Commands run under `/bin/sh` with the same privileges as the app, detached from it (they survive the monitor exiting or restarting), and with their output discarded - no terminal opens and no focus is stolen. This is ideal for background tasks like sending notifications, playing sounds, or running headless commands (e.g. `claude -p "..."`). Relative paths in commands are resolved relative to the application root (or the project root when running from source).

Each of these settings accepts a single command string or an array of strings to run multiple commands per event. When an array is provided, all commands are launched independently (fire-and-forget) - if one fails, the others still run.

Commands only fire on **state changes** detected while the app is running. On app startup, already-exceeded thresholds trigger a desktop notification but do not run `on_threshold_command` - this prevents duplicate commands after a restart or reboot.

`on_double_click_command` is the exception: it reacts to a user action, not a usage event. On Windows it runs on a tray icon double-click; the AppIndicator tray protocol has no double-click gesture, so on Linux the command gets its own tray menu entry instead, shown only while the command is configured.

Because that menu entry is user-driven, a command that fails to start - it exits with a non-zero (error) code within the first few seconds - shows its stderr in an error dialog, so a wrong path or a broken command is not swallowed silently. If the command starts an app, that app's later exit code is ignored. The automatic reset, threshold, and startup commands stay silent - they fire in the background and must not interrupt you with dialogs.

When `on_reset_command` is configured, the app wakes from idle/lock pause at the expected reset time so the command fires promptly on an unattended computer, retrying until the API confirms the reset. `on_threshold_command` does not wake from idle - thresholds follow active usage, so they are checked once polling resumes. Notifications raised while you were away are shown when you return.

> [!TIP]
> If you need a visible terminal, run your command inside one, e.g.:
> ```
> "on_reset_command": "x-terminal-emulator -e claude --continue"
> ```

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Test event commands** submenu in the tray context menu to fire your configured commands with sample data, without waiting for a real event. Commands fired this way print their exit code, stdout, and stderr - visible when you start the app from a terminal (e.g. `usage-monitor-for-claude` or `python3 -m usage_monitor_for_claude`) - and any non-zero exit code shows the stderr in an error dialog, however long the command ran. Event commands otherwise discard all output.

## Examples

### Resume a Claude Code session when the quota resets

```json
{
  "on_reset_command": "claude --continue -p \"Quota is available, resume task\""
}
```

`--continue` resumes the most recent conversation. Use `--resume <name>` to target a specific named session.

### Start a new 5-hour session at app start when none is active

Start the 5-hour session immediately at app launch instead of waiting for your first real message. Only fires when no 5-hour session is currently active:

```json
{
  "on_startup_command": "if [ -z \"$USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT_FIVE_HOUR\" ]; then claude -p \"ok\" --tools \"\" --no-session-persistence --system-prompt \"Reply with only: ok\" --output-format text; fi"
}
```

`USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT_FIVE_HOUR` is empty when no five-hour session is active, so the ping only fires after a reset already happened (e.g. overnight, or while the app was closed).

### Always keep a 5-hour session running

To cover both cases - the reset happening with the app running, **and** the app starting up after a reset already happened - configure both commands together:

```json
{
  "on_startup_command": "if [ -z \"$USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT_FIVE_HOUR\" ]; then claude -p \"ok\" --tools \"\" --no-session-persistence --system-prompt \"Reply with only: ok\" --output-format text; fi",
  "on_reset_command": "if [ \"$USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT\" = five_hour ]; then claude -p \"ok\" --tools \"\" --no-session-persistence --system-prompt \"Reply with only: ok\" --output-format text; fi"
}
```

`on_reset_command` handles the live case (5-hour session expires while the app is polling), `on_startup_command` handles the gap (app was closed when the reset happened, or you just turned the computer back on).

### Target a specific quota variant

Use `USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT` to run a command only when a specific quota resets:

```json
{
  "on_reset_command": "if [ \"$USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT\" = five_hour ]; then claude -p \"ok\" --tools \"\" --no-session-persistence --system-prompt \"Reply with only: ok\" --output-format text; fi"
}
```

The same pattern works for any variant (`seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, etc.) and for `on_threshold_command`.

### Only resume when both quotas have enough headroom

```json
{
  "on_reset_command": "if [ \"$USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION_FIVE_HOUR\" -lt 80 ] && [ \"$USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION_SEVEN_DAY\" -lt 95 ]; then claude --continue -p \"Quota is available, resume task\"; fi"
}
```

### Play a sound and send a push notification when the quota resets

```json
{
  "on_reset_command": [
    "paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga",
    "curl -s --data-urlencode \"token=<APP_TOKEN>\" --data-urlencode \"user=<USER_KEY>\" --data-urlencode \"title=$USAGE_MONITOR_TITLE\" --data-urlencode \"message=$USAGE_MONITOR_MESSAGE\" https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json"
  ]
}
```

### Send a Telegram message when a threshold is crossed

```json
{
  "on_threshold_command": "curl -s -X POST \"https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage\" -d chat_id=<ID> --data-urlencode \"text=$USAGE_MONITOR_MESSAGE\""
}
```

### Show an extra desktop notification when a threshold is crossed

The app already raises its own notifications; this is useful when you want a different urgency or wording:

```json
{
  "on_threshold_command": "notify-send -u critical \"$USAGE_MONITOR_TITLE\" \"$USAGE_MONITOR_MESSAGE\""
}
```

### Play a sound when a threshold is crossed

```json
{
  "on_threshold_command": "paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga"
}
```

`paplay` (PulseAudio/PipeWire) plays `.oga`, `.wav`, and other formats - most distributions ship sounds in `/usr/share/sounds/`. For `.mp3` files, use a player like `mpv`:

```json
{
  "on_threshold_command": "mpv --no-video --really-quiet ~/alert.mp3"
}
```

### Append events to a log file

```json
{
  "on_threshold_command": "echo \"$(date -Is) $USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT reached $USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION% (threshold $USAGE_MONITOR_THRESHOLD%)\" >> ~/claude-usage.log"
}
```

### Use a script file for complex logic

Different actions depending on quota type and threshold:

```json
{
  "alert_thresholds_five_hour": [80, 95],
  "alert_thresholds_seven_day": [95],
  "on_threshold_command": "~/bin/claude-notify.sh"
}
```

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# claude-notify.sh - different actions depending on quota type and threshold
# (make it executable: chmod +x ~/bin/claude-notify.sh)

# Session quota: play a warning sound at 80%, a critical sound at 95%
if [ "$USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT" = five_hour ]; then
    if [ "$USAGE_MONITOR_THRESHOLD" -ge 95 ]; then
        paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/dialog-warning.oga
    elif [ "$USAGE_MONITOR_THRESHOLD" -ge 80 ]; then
        paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/message.oga
    fi
fi

# Weekly quota: send a Pushover notification at 95%
if [ "$USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT" = seven_day ] && [ "$USAGE_MONITOR_THRESHOLD" -ge 95 ]; then
    curl -s \
        --data-urlencode "token=<APP_TOKEN>" \
        --data-urlencode "user=<USER_KEY>" \
        --data-urlencode "title=$USAGE_MONITOR_TITLE" \
        --data-urlencode "message=$USAGE_MONITOR_MESSAGE" \
        https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json > /dev/null
fi
```

## Environment Variables

Commands receive event details as environment variables. Commands run under `/bin/sh`, so access them as `$VAR` (quote them - `"$USAGE_MONITOR_MESSAGE"` - when the value may contain spaces).

### Common

Available in all event commands:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `USAGE_MONITOR_VERSION` | `1.13.0` | Running app version |

### `on_reset_command`

Fires whenever usage drops (not only when nearly exhausted).

| Variable | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EVENT` | `reset` | Event type |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT` | `five_hour` or `seven_day` | Which quota reset |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION` | `5` | Current usage of the reset quota (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_PREV_UTILIZATION` | `98` | Usage before the reset (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION_FIVE_HOUR` | `5` | Current session (5h) usage (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION_SEVEN_DAY` | `42` | Current weekly (7d) usage (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT` | `2025-01-15T18:00:00Z` | When the quota resets next (ISO 8601, UTC) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_TITLE` | `Quota Reset` | Notification title (localized) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_MESSAGE` | `Your quota has been reset...` | Notification message (localized) |

Both quota values are included so your script can check whether you are actually unblocked - the session quota may reset while the weekly quota is still at the limit. `USAGE_MONITOR_PREV_UTILIZATION` lets you act only on significant resets.

### `on_threshold_command`

Fires when usage crosses a configured alert threshold.

| Variable | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EVENT` | `threshold` | Event type |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT` | `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_opus`, `extra_usage` | Which quota is affected |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION` | `84` | Current usage percentage (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_THRESHOLD` | `80` | Threshold that was crossed (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT` | `2025-01-15T18:00:00Z` | When the quota resets (ISO 8601, UTC) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_TITLE` | `Usage Alert` | Notification title (localized) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_MESSAGE` | `Your session usage has reached 84%` | Notification message (localized) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EXTRA_USED` | `$8.20` | Amount spent (extra usage only) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EXTRA_LIMIT` | `$10.00` | Monthly limit (extra usage only) |

`USAGE_MONITOR_EXTRA_USED` and `USAGE_MONITOR_EXTRA_LIMIT` are only set when `USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT` is `extra_usage`.

### `on_startup_command`

Fires once after the first successful API update following app start (also after using the **Restart** menu option). Receives the full quota state so the command can decide what to do based on which sessions are active. Skipped when the first call fails (auth error, offline) - retries on the next successful poll.

| Variable | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EVENT` | `startup` | Event type |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION_FIVE_HOUR` | `0` | Current session (5h) usage (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT_FIVE_HOUR` | `2025-01-15T18:00:00Z` | When the 5h session resets, or empty if no session is active |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION_SEVEN_DAY` | `42` | Current weekly (7d) usage (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT_SEVEN_DAY` | `2025-01-20T12:00:00Z` | When the 7d window resets, or empty if no window is active |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EXTRA_USED` | `$8.20` | Amount spent (only set when extra usage is enabled) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EXTRA_LIMIT` | `$10.00` | Monthly limit (only set when extra usage is enabled) |

Per-quota variables are emitted for every quota field the API returns - additional variants like `USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION_SEVEN_DAY_SONNET` follow the same pattern. An empty `USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT_*` indicates that the quota has no active window (either never used, or the previous window has expired).

### `on_double_click_command`

Fires when you activate the command's tray menu entry. Receives the same full quota state as `on_startup_command`, taken from the most recent successful update.

| Variable | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EVENT` | `double_click` | Event type |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION_FIVE_HOUR` | `0` | Current session (5h) usage (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT_FIVE_HOUR` | `2025-01-15T18:00:00Z` | When the 5h session resets, or empty if no session is active |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_UTILIZATION_SEVEN_DAY` | `42` | Current weekly (7d) usage (integer) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_RESETS_AT_SEVEN_DAY` | `2025-01-20T12:00:00Z` | When the 7d window resets, or empty if no window is active |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EXTRA_USED` | `$8.20` | Amount spent (only set when extra usage is enabled) |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_EXTRA_LIMIT` | `$10.00` | Monthly limit (only set when extra usage is enabled) |

Per-quota variables are emitted for every quota field the API returns, following the same pattern as `on_startup_command`. If you activate the entry before the first successful update, only `USAGE_MONITOR_EVENT` is set.
